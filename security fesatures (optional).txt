/api/dev/login
✅ API authentication & middleware (ensuring only authenticated developers can access routes).
✅ Token-based authentication for user-related operations.
✅ Enhancing API rate-limiting and security.

/api/dev/logout
✅ Session Management: If using JWT, you might also want to blacklist the token in the database/cache to prevent misuse.
✅ Protect Routes: Ensure /api/dev/logout is only accessible when the user is authenticated.
✅ Frontend Integration: Make sure the frontend clears any user session data when this API is called.

/api/dev/delete
✅ Frontend Handling: Redirect users to the login page after deletion.
✅ Token Revocation (Optional): Consider maintaining a blacklist of revoked JWTs.
✅ Rate Limiting (Optional): Prevent abuse by limiting account deletion attempts.

/api/dev/profile
✅ Frontend Handling: Ensure proper error handling if the token is invalid.
✅ Middleware Integration (Optional): Implement middleware for authentication instead of calling DataFromJWT in every API.
